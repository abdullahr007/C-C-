Part A)

As we commented out ("using namespace std")
Now compiler is showing as error as it does not
know that we are using standard namespace and it 
does not identity these name classes.Just by writting
"using namespace std" or by writting "std::" as prefix 
for all the expressions which requires this and
this problem will be solved.

Part B)

There is actually nothing wrong until we reach the point where
we are trying to reference varaible(member of that critter).
Compiler interprets the function as standalone,"Critter" is
reposnible to tell that it is a member function of Critter class.
